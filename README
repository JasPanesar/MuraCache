MURA CACHE PLUGIN
This is an alpha plugin that enables Mura to use native named caches in both Adobe CF 9.0.1 and Railo. 

RAILO ONLY
In Railo you will need to explicitly create two caches. One named "data" and another named "output" before isntalling the plugin.
Or, if you want each site to have it's own data and output cache you can create caches following the syntax for each site in your Mura instance:

{siteID}-data
{siteID}-output

So for the default site the cache names would look like this:
default-data
default-output
